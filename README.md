# Linear Regression
This is linear regression with gradient descent.

## Overview
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied.The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use linear regression to prove this relationship.

## Dependencies
* numpy
* python3

## Usage
Just run ``python3 linear_regression.py`` to see the results:

 ```
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473
 ```
